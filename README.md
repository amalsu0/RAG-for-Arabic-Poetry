# RAG-for-Arabic-Poetry
The Arabic Poetry Dataset is a rich and diverse resource, containing over 70,000 poems by more than 750 poets spanning from the 6th to the 20th century. This dataset offers valuable insights into the evolution of themes, styles, and poetic structures across various eras. It provides a unique opportunity to explore and preserve Arabic literary heritage while aiding in the development of AI-powered educational and cultural tools.

This project leverages the dataset to build a custom chatbot capable of answering queries about Arabic poetry, including poet names, eras, and poetic meters, with high accuracy and contextual relevance. By utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot combines semantic search with the power of GPT-based models to retrieve relevant information and generate accurate, context-aware responses.
